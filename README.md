# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project is helping Tom to go over the tasks that need to be completed for the election audit, and discuss the information needed by the Colorado Board of Elections. At the end we are going to deliver the following information by Python script: 
* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of each counties who recieved votes
* The largest number of votes country
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate received
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
Data Resource: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.63.2

## Results
The analysis of the election show that:
* There were 369711 votes cast in the election.
* A complete list of each counties who recieved votes
  - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
 
* The largest number of votes country: Denver
  
* The Candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

* The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham reveived 23.0% of vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Diana DeGette reveived 73.8% of vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane reveived 3.1% of vote and 11,606 number of votes. 
* The winner of the election was:
  - Winner: Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Summary
  This script performs calculation and analysis by retrieving candidate information, regional information and votes. Because of its simple structure and regular coding, it can be easily used on many different election occasions.
For example 1. You can simply change the "county" to "city", "province" or even "country" to analyze the situation of the electoral area. 2. The candidate analysis can be rewritten as a political party situation analysis, to know the proportion and results of each political party.

## Challenge Overview
This challenge helps and guides us on how to use python and can be easily programmed with VBC. The program is written can extract, analyze and realize the desired analysis results on the date of election results.
## Challenge Summary
This task is a challenge for me as this is my first exposure to python. Through the step-by-step analysis and explanation of the course, I have a preliminary understanding and understanding of python and can perform simple coding and analysis. Although there are still many areas that are not proficient, there is still a lot to continue to learn.
